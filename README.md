# AngularJS On Rails Demonstratration Application

Heavily based upon the work of Daniel Nelson and his [AngularJS Rails Demo](https://github.com/centresource/angularjs_rails_demo), this project aims to build an AngularJS application coupled to a Rails application organically. This will inform future decisions based on the lessons learned through building a new application from scratch.
